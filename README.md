In the `data/` directory, the `raw/` and `processed/` subdirectories are typically used to store different stages of the election data:

1. **Raw Data (`data/raw/`):**
   - This directory contains the original, unprocessed election data obtained from various sources such as government databases, election commissions, or third-party providers.
   - Raw data files may be in different formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, or databases, depending on the source.
   - It's essential to preserve the raw data in its original state without any modifications for reproducibility and data lineage purposes.

2. **Processed Data (`data/processed/`):**
   - This directory stores the cleaned, transformed, and preprocessed version of the election data.
   - Processed data files are typically organized and formatted for analysis, machine learning, or visualization tasks.
   - Data preprocessing steps may include cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates), transforming (e.g., feature engineering, normalization), and aggregating (e.g., summarizing data at different levels).
   - Processed data files may be in the same format as raw data or converted to a standardized format for consistency.

For the VoteFlow project, the `raw/` directory would contain the original election datasets obtained from relevant sources. These datasets may include information such as voter demographics, election results, candidate profiles, and polling station data.

The `processed/` directory would store the cleaned, transformed, and aggregated versions of the election data ready for analysis and modeling. This processed data may include features engineered from the raw datasets, aggregated statistics, and any additional preprocessing steps performed to prepare the data for machine learning or visualization tasks.

It's essential to maintain clear documentation and version control for both raw and processed data to ensure reproducibility and traceability of the analysis conducted in the VoteFlow project.
